# Extreme Rainfall in Niamey
## Abstract
A repository with some of the scripts that were used to analyse rainfall in Niamey, Niger. This includes some exploratory data analysis, maximum likelihood estimation to fit extreme value distributions and gamma distributions, and building a Markov chain of rainfall existence to simulate 100's of years of rainfall.

## Context
This project was completed in spring 2024 and includes all of the code to support my dissertation. This was one of my first data science projects. The code is poorly annotated as it was not marked further and has lots of innefficiencies but it produced strong findings.
