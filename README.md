# extreme-rainfall-sahel
A repository with some of the scripts that were used to analyse rainfall in Niamey, Niger. This includes some exploratory data analysis, maximum likelihood estimation to fit extreme value distributions and gamma distributions, and building a Markov chain of rainfall existence to simulate 100's of years of rainfall.
